    <p>So to take a quick instance where this might be worth it, instead of transferring 25,000 points to Delta to book a roundtrip domestic economy award from New York LGA to Miami, I could go through Amex travel and pay either $219 for the ticket or use 21,879 points at a rate of 1 cent per point. Still not a high-value redemption, but a way to save a couple hundred dollars with some spare points if I had them, plus Iâ€™d still get mileage and elite credit for the flights.</p>
